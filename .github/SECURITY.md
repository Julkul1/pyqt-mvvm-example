2. **Email us directly** at [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL] with the subject line `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report`.
3. Include the following information in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
   - Your contact information

### What to Expect

- You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours
- We will investigate the report and provide updates

### Security Best Practices

When using this application:

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update your Python packages and PyQt6
2. **Use virtual environments**: Isolate your project dependencies
3. **Validate inputs**: Always validate user inputs in your fuzzy logic systems
4. **Secure file operations**: Be careful with file paths and permissions
5. **Network security**: If adding network features, use secure protocols

### Known Security Considerations

- **File system access**: The application may read/write files based on user input
- **Data validation**: Ensure fuzzy logic inputs are properly validated
- **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be clearly marked in the release notes.

### Contact Information
